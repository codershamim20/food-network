                <h3>Great Quick Meal</h3>
                <p>"I normally don't write reviews for fast food. However this place stands out. It is clean, friendly service, and much better than average food for the price. I tried a baked potato and it was as good as any baked potato in any restaurant! This is a great place!" Devid H Michel.

                <h3>Good Food, Nice Facilities, but GREAT STAFF!</h3>
                <p>"After eating at this restaurant 3-4 times, the thing my wife and I have commented on the most is the Staff...we have gotten quick and excellent service not only at the register but the staff is constantly checking on the tables to make sure everything is to your liking. The outstanding feature is the Staff.Don't get me wrong, we enjoy the food (especially the fish) and the restaurant is bright, airy and spotlessly clean.            
                But so far, the Staff is the most outstanding feature for us regardless of what restaurant one is talking about!" Clarkson Hamilton.

                <p>
                    "Went there with my child twice in the last week. She loved the butterfly shrimp and I loved the fish! This is a fairly new restaurant but is by far one of the best Captain D's I have eaten at. Both times, the food was hot and properly prepared, the employees were very friendly and the restrooms clean. The price is good for the portion size. On both visits, our food was brought to our table right after we had made our drinks and sat down. We will be eating here on a regular basis!" Margaret Hellen
